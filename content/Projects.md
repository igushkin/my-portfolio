## Project 2
name::ExploreWithMe
description::The application allows users to share information about interesting events and helps to find a company to participate in them. It is implemented in the form of two microservices with separate databases - one service for saving and receiving statistics, the second is implemented by the main business logic.
date::tomorrow
contribution::Implemented a statistics service in accordance with the provided specification, including the creation of endpoints and interaction with the database, and developed an HTTP client for this service.|Created a docker file to configure the launch of containers for project services, as well as individual PostgreSQL instances for statistics and basic services.|Wrote integration and unit tests to ensure the reliability of the application.

## Project 4
name::Rocket Game
description::Rocket Game is a Windows Forms Motion Simulation app that was created for the sake of interest The movement of objects and their interaction is described using basic arithmetic operations with two-dimensional vectors.
date::tomorrow
contribution::Developed multiple game levels, each featuring distinct gravitational conditions. These include a zero-gravity level, a level with standard downward gravity, another with upward gravity, a level with a white hole exerting repulsive force, and a level with a black hole drawing the player towards it.|Wrote an algorithm that manages the rocket, enabling it to navigate and successfully exit any level, regardless of the gravitational conditions.
